# temp-mobile-sdk-apps
A temporary repo to host the sample apps that integrate with our WIP TX Native mobile SDKs (iOS + Android)

In order to run either the Swift or the Objective-C sample apps, you will need to duplicate
the `Secrets.xcconfig.sample` file found in each project and rename it to `Secrets.xcconfig` and then 
change the values for the `TRANSIFEX_TOKEN` and `TRANSIFEX_SECRET` keys.
